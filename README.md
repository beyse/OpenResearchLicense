# OpenResearchLicense

> :warning: **DISCLAIMER**: I am not a lawyer. Nothing here is legal advice.

Open Research License is derived from [Java Research License (JRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Research_License) Version 1.6 found [here](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/Java_Research_License).

You can see the changes to the license in the commit history. I made the changes because I wanted to use a license exactly like the JRL but can generally be applied to any software without the *Java* and *Sun* terminology.  

| Permissions | Limitations | Conditions |

The file `open_research_license.txt` contains the actual Open Research License.
The file `LICENSE` releases all files in here to the public domain. So everybody can use the Open Research License for every purpose.
