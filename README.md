# Open Research License

> :warning: **DISCLAIMER**: I am not a lawyer. Nothing here is legal advice.

Open Research License is derived from [Java Research License (JRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Research_License) Version 1.6 found [here](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/Java_Research_License).

You can see the changes to the license in the commit history.

| Permissions | Limitations | Conditions |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
|:green_circle: Academic use       |:x: Commercial use | :large_blue_circle: License and copyright notice  |
|:green_circle: Private use        |:x: Liability      |  |
|:green_circle: Distribution       |:x: Warranty       |  |
|:green_circle: Modification       |  |  |

The file `open_research_license.txt` contains the actual Open Research License.
The file `LICENSE` releases all files in here to the public domain. So everybody can use the Open Research License for every purpose.

## Why?

I made the changes because I wanted to use a license exactly like the JRL but can generally be applied to any software without the *Java* and *Sun* terminology. 
I have not found a suitable license after searching online, so I created this one. Most open software licenses I have found do also allow commercial use, however I wanted the license to prohibit commercial use.   
 
If you are aware of any other or similar license which also fit my criteria, please let me know. I am happy to learn.
